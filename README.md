# HYUNDAI-STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING


# Stock Price Prediction 

This is a simple machine learning project where I tried to predict stock prices using historical data. I used Python and a few ML models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to see how well they perform.

## What this project does

The notebook does the following:
- Collects stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`
- Cleans and explores the data
- Visualizes stock trends over time
- Trains and evaluates models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Compares their performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- yfinance

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-ml.git
cd stock-price-prediction-ml
